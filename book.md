# Build Stuff.  A book about computering.

This is not a book about how to work in a particular programming
language.  This is a book about building stuff.  Hopefully this is
something you'd like to try, but if not then perhaps a better title is
"Help People.  A book about helping others through computering."

No, "computering" is not a real word.
