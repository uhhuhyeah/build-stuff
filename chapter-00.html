<p class="author-note">This is the part where you download Google Chrome.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $(function() {
      if (/chrome/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
          $('#download-chrome').hide();
          $('#already-have-chrome').show();
          $('#step-1-header').css({'text-decoration': 'line-through'});
      }
  });

<div id="download-chrome">
  <p>
    Go to the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="new">Google Chrome
    download page</a> and click on the big button that says &ldquo;Download
    Google Chrome&rdquo;.
  </p>
  <p>
    Follow the instructions for installing Google Chrome to your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Launch Google Chrome.
  </p>
</div>
<p id="already-have-chrome" style="display:none;">
  You already have Google Chrome!  You're awesome!  Please proceed to
  <em>Step 2</em>.
</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Open the Console.</h2>
<p>
  Google Chrome has this awesome thing called the <em>Console</em> that can be
  used to interact with all kinds of stuff.  It's a fully-capable tool that
  professional developers regularly use to develop, test, and debug.
</p>
<p>
  To open the <em>Console</em>, click on the &ldquo;wrench&rdquo; icon in the
  top corner of Google Chrome.
</p>
<p>
  Now hover over &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; and select &ldquo;JavaScript
  Console&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
  You should see the <em>Console</em> pop open either as a separate window or
  as a little sub-window within your main browser window.
</p>
<p class="fancy-pants">
  If you're a real fancy pants, you may have noticed there is a keyboard shortcut
  available for opening the <em>Console</em>.  Use it if you want to.  Now your
  pants are even more fancy.
</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Make sure you know how to open Google Chrome and open the console.</h2>
<p>
  Seriously, you need to make sure you know how to open Google Chrome.  With
  any luck, part of the installation process placed a launcher somewhere that's
  easy to see.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a joke.  Close your current Google Chrome browser session and
  make sure you know how to get it back open.  Then make sure you know how to open
  the <em>Console</em>.
</p>

<p class="author-note">
  Perhaps the first chapter should be about familiarization with the Chrome
  console?  Or should that come <strong>after</strong> overwriting a web page?
