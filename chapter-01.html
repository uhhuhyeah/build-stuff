<p>
  This is the part where we start to build some stuff.
</p>

<p>
  The funny part is that we're going to start by learning
  how to destroy stuff.
</p>

<h2>How to delete a web page.</h2>

<p>
  Pick a website and go there.
</p>

<p>
  Open up the Console.
</p>

<p>
  Type in <code>document.write()</code> and hit the Enter key.
</p>

<p>
  More code examples go here.
</p>

<p>
  Not worrying about saving files or correct document structure yet.
