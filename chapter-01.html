<h2>How to delete a web page.</h2>

<p>
  Locate the refresh button in Chrome.  You'll be using it real soon.
</p>

<p>
  Open up the Console.  If you don't know what the Console is or how to open
  it, you should click <em>Previous</em> and do a quick review.
</p>

<p>
  In the console, type in the following and <em>before you hit the Enter key
  make sure you really know where the refresh button is located</em>.  It's
  the button you'll be hitting after you hit the Enter key.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
document.write()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Now hit the Enter key.
