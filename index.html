<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>
  This is not a book about how to work in a particular programming
  language.  This is a book about building stuff.  Hopefully this is
  something you'd like to try, but if not then perhaps a better title is
  "Help People.  A book about helping others through computering."

<p>
  No, "computering" is not a real word.
