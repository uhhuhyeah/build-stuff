<p>
  This is not a book about how to work in a particular programming
  language.  This is a book about building stuff.  Hopefully this is
  something you'd like to try, but if not then perhaps a better title is
  &ldquo;Help People.  A book about helping others through the building of stuff.&rdquo;

  You won't be learning everything you need from this book alone.
  There will be detours along the way in which you'll be sent off to the
  internet to research one topic or another.  This is a
  <strong>good thing</strong> since there are so many wonderful
  sources of information freely available online.
</p>

<p>
  There are also some less-than-awesome sources of information online.
  We'll be doing our best to <em>not</em> lead you toward these.

<p class="author-note">
  Talk about what kinds of projects we'll be doing.  The first project is going
  to be a <strong>User Script</strong> that can be installed in Chrome.
</p>

<p class="author-note">
  What's the correct level of difficulty for a first project?  Does it have to
  be at least somewhat practical?
