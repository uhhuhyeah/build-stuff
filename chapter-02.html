  Hopefully we can all agree that this paragraph looks pretty gross.
  We're going to fix it.  Mostly.

  Open up the Console.

</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
newStyle = document.createElement('style');
newStyle.textContent = 'p.uglified { background: #eee; color: #222; } ';
head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
head.appendChild(newStyle);
{% endhighlight %}
